## Twitter_Data_Wrangling
## by (Maram Alobaid)

#### I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

The project is based around the "WeRateDogs" Twitter page, a page which will kindly rate pictures
and videos of dogs out of ten. Since dogs are all round fantastic creatures, all of WeRateDogs’ ratings are above ten. They also tag each dog with a different category out of 
“doggo”, “floofer”, “pupper”, or “puppo”. An archive of this Twitter data for WeRateDogs’ tweets was provided for this project as a CSV file. Two more sources of data were also 
gathered as part of this project: predictions for which type of dog is present in each picture (carried out previously, not by myself, by being passed throughan image classification algorithm) and additional tweet information acquired from Twitter.
In this project I use three steps of data wrangling: gathering, assessing, cleaning. For the gathering phase, the image prediction data was downloaded using Python's Requests library. The additional Twitter information (i.e. retweet and favorite counts) 
was downloaded using the tweet-JSON file. Then in assessing, I explore the data in order to find any quality or tidiness issues. Finally, in the cleaning step, I have implemented
some steps to fix the quality and tidiness issues that were previously identified.Lastly, the data wrangling process, data was carried out numerous interesting results were observed.
